# Administrator-Dashboard
Termi-LOL is a fictitious application that allows users to manage
various development projects, much like any other task management system.
This is a simple homepage for the application that has no real functionality.
It is built using HTML and CSS. CSS Grid and Flexbox are used together to
achieve the layout.
